This is similar to the standard yeast bread just with sourdough. It is the
most basic sourdough bread that you can make.

It has an excellent taste, is fluffy and at the same time crispy.
It's an excellent starter for various meals. Serving it with butter or
olive oil is recommended and creates an incredible taste experience.
It also combines nicely with dips or alongside the sauce of your main course.

In comparison to the yeast version the sourness adds a nice amount of flavour to your bread.
